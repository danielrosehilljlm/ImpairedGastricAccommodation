## Diet Recommendations

### What is impaired gastric accommodation (IGA)

Impaired gastric accommodation (IGA) means that the stomach has difficulty expanding to "receive" food due to (probably) damage to the vagus nerve and/or nitrergic nerve dysfunction. This creates upper gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating, belching, early saiety, and postprandial discomfort as well (anecdotally) as a feeling of a "blockage" after eating food or ingesting liquids. 

Gastric accomodation can be evaluated using a variety of diagnostic tests, some of which are only available in research / tertiary referral settings (typically those specializing in the treatment and diagnosis of FD). These include barometric evaluation of stomach accommodation (essentially, inflating a baloon in the stomach and evaluating pressure) and abdominal ultrasound. 

Research indicates that as many as 40% of patients diagnosed with functional dyspepsia (FD) have impaired gastric accommodation and most of the symptoms that are thought to be attributable to IGA are shared by FD, indicating that it is a substantial cause of the latter's symptomology. Abdominal surgeries are also known to commonly result in the condition, particularly Nissen fundopolication. Like post-surgical gastroparesis, the assumed mechanism is damage to the vagus nerve. 

I am "open sourcing" my dietary approach to managing the condition for two reasons:

a) To help myself keep track of what to eat and what not to eat
b) To potentially provide other patients with a starting point for interventions that might help. There is currently a paucity of patient-oriented information about IGA on the internet.

My approach to minimizing symptoms is based on a modified version of the gastroparesis diet. If a food or drink dramatically increases symptoms, I take note of that, and add it to the "do not eat" list. It also focuses, generally, on maintaining motility and avoiding foods and liquids that inhibit gastric emptying.

### General Guidelines

The simplest dietary recommdation — which is shared by gastroparesis patients — is to eat smaller meals and drink less liquid at any one time. 

### Do Not Consume (DNC)

Based on trial and error, the following foods and liquids are on my 'do not eat' list. Through keeping a food journal, I have been able to pinpoint these as causes of symptoms.

| Do not Consume  | Consume Instead |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Large meals  | Small meals  |
| Fermented alcoholic beverages  | Distilled alcoholic beverages  |
| Beef burgers | Meat products not made from ground meat |
| Plain water | Water infused with electrolytes |
| Cold water | Room temperature water |


### Drinks

Gastroparesis (GP) patients frequently complain that they cannot tolerate plain water, particularly served cold. I also have this symptom. If I drink plain water, it feels as if the water "sits" in my stomach followed by burping. This persists until the discomfort passess, but it can take a good hour if not more. Not fun! The closest description of this is "postprandial fullness." Like GP patients, I have found that adding electrolyte powder to water greatly reduces this symptom. Nobody seems to quite understand why plain water triggers symptoms and other water-based mixes don't, but differences in pH and other chemical properties like osmosity may be the explanation.

Whatever the cause may be, I have learned that I can avoid the worst of the discomfort that drinking water entails by either making an electrolyte mix or drinking beverages that I would previously have avoided because I thought them unhealthy, like soda.

This seuges to an important point: the typical dietary recommendations for gastroparesis which I am working around differ rather dramatically from what is typically considered 'healthy'. For instance, while low fat is a common dietary recommendation low fiber in most cases isn't. Likewise, few dieticians would advocate that their patients drink sugary beverages in place of water. The most helpful thing I have found in minimizing symptoms is learning to get comfortable with ignoring conventional dietary advice and relying instead upon what works for me to minimize symptoms and discomfort. Doing this involves the usual method (keeping a food diary). The objective, of course, is to restrict as few foods as possible.

### Alcohol

Several months after my gallbladder surgery, when I first attempted to drink alcohol, I found that I got extremely nauseous after just two beers. Searching online, I found hundreds of other postcholecystectomy patients with the exact same complaint. The symptoms were replicated after drinking wine. But not, curiously, spirits or spirit-based cocktails. 

I believe that the answer may be explicable by Franke and Teyssen's findings [as reported](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8343573_Effect_of_ethanol_and_alcoholic_beverages_on_gastric_emptying_in_men) in the Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology.

In "Effect of ethanol and alcoholic beverages on gastric emptying in men" the researchers noted:

> There is a paucity of detailed and controlled studies on the action of ethanol and alcoholic beverages on gastric emptying in humans. This study was designed to compare the effect of beer, red wine, whisky and their comparable pure  ethanol solutions on gastric emptying in a controlled and randomized investigation. On separate days, 10 healthy, fasted subjects received the following solutions, in random order, through a gastric tube: 500 mL beer, red wine, comparable pure ethanol solutions .... Gastric emptying of the test solutions was assessed using ultrasonography of the antrum. As measured by ultrasonography of the antrum, half emptying times of the ethanol solutions (4%, 10% and 40% v/v) were significantly (P < 0.05) longer (22.6 +/- 4.8, 22.7 +/- 4.3 and 27.8 +/- 3.3 min, respectively, n=10) than those of water (14.6 +/- 1.9 min (500 mL) and 13.2 +/- 1.7 min (250 mL), respectively). The half emptying times of beer (39.3 +/- 4.3 min) and red wine (72.6 +/- 7.6 min) were significantly longer than those of the corresponding ethanol concentrations, whereas whisky was emptied at nearly the same rate (26.4 +/- 5.9 min) as 40% (v/v) ethanol. Emptying of glucose 5.5% and 11.4% (w/v) was significantly and dose dependently slower (29.7 +/- 4.5 and 64.8 +/- 8.9 min) than water. 1) Pure ethanol in concentrations of 4%, 10% and 40% (v/v) inhibits gastric emptying. 2) The inhibitory effect of beer and red wine, but not of whisky, is stronger than that of their comparable ethanol concentrations. 3) Caloric content and non-alcoholic ingredients in alcoholic beverages produced by fermentation (beer and wine), but not in those produced by distillation (whisky), are most likely responsible for this effect.

In other words, fermented beverages appear to inhibit gastric emptying to a greater degree than distilled beverages, although the researchers were not sure why. I have found that I am now able to tolerate a moderate quantity of spirits or spirit-based cocktails irrespective of what the latter is mixed with.


### Caffeine

Coffeee does not seem to provoke symptoms. However, those interested in minimizing their consumption of liquids may wish to consider replacing coffee with caffeine tablets.
