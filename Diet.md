## Diet Recommendations

### What is impaired gastric accommodation (IGA)

Impaired gastric accommodation (IGA) means that the stomach has difficulty expanding to "receive" food due to (probably) damage to the vagus nerve and/or nitrergic nerve dysfunction. This creates upper gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating, belching, early saiety, and postprandial discomfort as well (anecdotally) as a feeling of a "blockage" after eating food or ingesting liquids. 

Gastric accomodation can be evaluated using a variety of diagnostic tests, some of which are only available in research / tertiary referral settings (typically those specializing in the treatment and diagnosis of FD). These include barometric evaluation of stomach accommodation (essentially, inflating a baloon in the stomach and evaluating pressure) and abdominal ultrasound. Research indicates that as many as 40% of patients diagnosed with functional dyspepsia (FD) have impaired gastric accommodation and most of the symptoms that are thought to be attributable to IGA are shared by FD, indicating that it is a substantial cause of the latter's symptomology. Abdominal surgeries are also known to commonly result in the condition, particularly Nissen fundopolication. Like post-surgical gastroparesis, the assumed mechanism is damage to the vagus nerve. 

I am "open sourcing" my dietary approach to managing the condition for two reasons:

a) To help myself keep track of what to eat and what not to eat
b) To potentially provide other patients with a starting point for interventions that might help. There is currently a paucity of patient-oriented information about IGA on the internet.

My approach to minimizing symptoms is based on a modified version of the gastroparesis diet. If a food or drink dramatically increases symptoms, I take note of that, and add it to the "do not eat" list. It also focuses, generally, on maintaining motility and avoiding foods and liquids that inhibit gastric emptying.

### General Guidelines

The simplest dietary recommdation — which is shared by gastroparesis patients — is to eat smaller meals and drink less liquid at any one time. 

### Do Not Consume (DNC)

Based on trial and error, the following foods and liquids are on my 'do not eat' list. Through keeping a food journal, I have been able to pinpoint these as causes of symptoms.

| Do not Consume  | Consume Instead |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Large meals  | Small meals  |
| Fermented alcoholic beverages  | Distilled alcoholic beverages  |
| Beef burgers | Meat products not made from ground meat |
| Plain water | Water infused with electrolytes |
| Cold water | Room temperature water |


### Drinks

### Alcohol

### Caffeine
